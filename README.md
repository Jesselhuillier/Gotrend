# golang-tour

This Git will be a full tour of Golang language
you will find all the informations, instructions and sample codes you need to download, install, test, initialize and run basics functions on your Golang app

# important

## Root

Please note that each sub repository will be considered as \$HOME while working inside
so for example in the Instalation phase :

```bash
$ cd $HOME/go/src/hello
```

Will stand for :

```bash
$ cd $HOME/golang-tour/installation/go/src/hello
```

## Follow up

Please note that all the steps have an order, so each step will take for granted all the information explained in the previous steps
For exemple, if you're following the third step _3-my_first_app_, the previous steps will be considered as known (how to install Golang and Init a workspace)
